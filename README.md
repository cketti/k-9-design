## K-9 Mail is a FOSS Android mail client. 
This design celebrates the expressive nature of K-9. It welcomes tinkering, customizing, and adapting the app to anyone’s needs. Attempting to get out of the way in favor of utility, without sacrificing delight. It’s highly modifiable and customizable - from specific settings (now neatly organized) to signatures and modular color themes.

#### Developers - how to use this repo
- You can see a high level view of the entire app flow in **Flows**. Each screen is labeled.
- To see a specific screen up close you can find it in the **Screens** folder. 
- Specific measurements, colors, spacing etc are annotated for each screen in the **Specs** folder. 
- A central style guide with set colors, typography, spacing is currently still being worked on. 

Need a specific value that isn’t annotated? The K-9 design file is also available on [Zeplin](https://zpl.io/ZEjQ4O) - a collaborative tool for engineers and designers to work together. It’s free to register, and you can click around and get all the visual details you need.

#### Designers - want to help?

- Please help design new user stories! Take a look at the user survey summary for new feature ideas. 
- Design-engineer communication and documentation could always use some help. It ensures designs are built to spec. You can help by creating annotated design documents, or any other artifacts that help collaboration.

Note: We need to expand functionality above anything else. This design is by no means perfect, but it’s a starting point. Redesigning this version for pure aesthetic value is not really a priority at this point. It should definitely be explored in the future, but it’s best to wait until this version of the design is launched first.
